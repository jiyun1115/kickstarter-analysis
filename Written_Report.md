Title: Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to analyze the level of success (successful, failed, canceled) of the fundraising by date launched and goal amount.

## Analysis and Challenges
 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Analysis was done using pivot table in Excel filtering by "Theater". 
Number of successful, failed and canceled fundraising were listed by months.A line chart wasn created.
Field of "Count of Outcome" was used for Y-Axis and the field of "Date" was used for the X-Axis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Analysis was done using the codes, "COUNTIFS" and "ROUND" and Percentage formula using excel. (Screenshots are saved as separate file)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
1. In analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals, creating codes for COUNTIFS for different ranges were challenging.For some reason, the numbers did not match with the total numbers from the original worksheet.
2. In analysis of Outcomes by Launch Date, missing data for 'Canceled" column was something that had to be dealt with.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. Month of May, June, July (late spring-summer) showed highest number of projects and successes while month of Dec and Jan (Winter) showed lowest number of projects and successes.
2. Number of failed is fairly consistent across months.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Goal amount less than $5000 had highest percentage of success. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 
1. The dataset was compliled based on the name of the project and there is not information on the demographics of the backers or other information to critically review the reason for failures to improve the fundraising. 
2. Overall the goals were set very low which raises the possibility of success.
3. Data is mostly from US.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
For Outcomes by launch date, stacked Bar graphs. 
For outcomes based on goals, Pie charts for percentage.
